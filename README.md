# LogisticRegression
Data Cleanup and Prediction Tool  This is a user-friendly tool that helps you clean messy data, fix missing values, and make predictions using a technique called logistic regression. No coding is required â€“ just load your data, clean it up, and predict outcomes. Great for data enthusiasts and analysts!
This project experience involved the application of logistic regression for binary classification, proficiently addressing missing data, creating insightful data visualizations, and rigorous data cleaning. Logistic regression empowered me to predict outcomes effectively. I acquired expertise in managing missing data through imputation methods and harnessed data visualization libraries to present findings visually. Creating various plots, from scatter plots to heatmaps, enriched data interpretation. My data cleaning skills ensured the dataset's quality by identifying and rectifying inconsistencies, handling categorical variables, and performing feature scaling when necessary. These skills collectively enhanced the project's accuracy, reliability, and ability to derive actionable insights, contributing significantly to its successful execution.
